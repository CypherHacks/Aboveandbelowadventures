      text: "With thanks to Trip Advisor, I came across this company and decided to book two tours with them. One, being the private Petra tour and the other was the Sunset jeep tour of Wadi Rum.\
            I highly recommend this company to anyone looking to book a trip in Jordan. Rebecca in the Aqaba office, handled our bookings. She is from Italy, and fluent in a handful of languages. No detail was lost in translation.\
            Nazeh was our driver for the Petra tour and our guide for the Wadi Rum tour. He was great to chat too and full of information.\
            Mamoun was our guide in Petra. He was fantastic. Incredibly knowledgeable and his English was incredibly good.\
            If/when I return to Jordan, I'll be in touch with this company again to book further tours.\
            I cannot recommend highly enough."

      text: "We decided not to stay in Wadi Rum, but instead to base ourselves in Aqaba and go for the day.\
      We found this company through several sources and liked the range of day trip options.\
      Prices were reasonable compared to other companies and good value for what was included.\
      Communication prior to our departure was easy, response rate was quick and they were flexible.\
      We opted to call in at the office the day prior to our trip to pay and organise pick-up.\
      At about 4:30 am, a car was waiting for us.\
      We were just the two of us with the driver (I think it was Mr Khalid - a photo is included), who spoke very good English and was great company for the day.\
      We did a balloon ride and then a 3 h trip in a 4x4 with lots of stops and tea at a camp. The balloon ride was organised with another company (another review).\
      We had another driver for the 4x4 and Mr Khalid came with us.\
      While the 4x4 vehicle was not the flashest,\
      it was the best because we were only the two of us in the back compared to the fancy trucks with 8-10 squashed in \
      plus our drivers tried to take us to the sites between the groups so we felt like we were alone. We had a brilliant day and highly recommend Above and Beyond."
